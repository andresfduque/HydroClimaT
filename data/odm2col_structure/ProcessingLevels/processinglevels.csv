ProcessingLevelID,ProcessingLevelCode,Definition,Explanation
1,0,Raw Data,"Raw data is defined as unprocessed data and data products that have not undergone quality control. Depending on the data type and data transmission system, raw data may be available within seconds or minutes after real-time. Examples include real time precipitation, streamflow and water quality measurements"
2,1,Quality Controlled Data,Quality controlled data have passed quality assurance procedures such as routine estimation of timing and sensor calibration or visual inspection and removal of obvious errors. An example is USGS published streamflow records following parsing through USGS quality control procedures.
3,2,Derived Products,Derived products require scientific and technical interpretation and include multiple-sensor data. An example might be basin average precipitation derived from rain gages using an interpolation procedure.
4,3,Interpreted Products,"These products require researcher (PI) driven analysis and interpretation, model-based interpretation using other data and/or strong prior assumptions. An example is basin average precipitation derived from the combination of rain gages and radar return data."
5,4,Knowledge Products,These products require researcher (PI) driven scientific interpretation and multidisciplinary data integration and include model-based interpretation using other data and/or strong prior assumptions. An example is percentages of old or new water in a hydrograph inferred from an isotope analysis.
