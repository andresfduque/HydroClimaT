Table: GroupDescriptions

The GroupDescriptions table lists the descriptions for each of the groups of data values that have
been formed.

CREATE TABLE GroupDescriptions (
	GroupID serial unique,
	GroupDescription text,
	PRIMARY KEY (GroupID)
	);

The following rules and best practices should be used in populating this table:
	1. This table will only be populated if groups of data values have been created in the ODM
	database.
	2. The GroupID field is the primary key, must be a unique integer, and cannot be NULL. It
	should be implemented as an auto number/identity field.
	3. The GroupDescription can be any text string that describes the group of observations.
