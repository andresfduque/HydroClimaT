Table: LabMethods

The LabMethods table contains descriptions of the laboratory methods used to analyze physical
samples for specific constituents.

CREATE TABLE LabMethods (
	LabMethodID serial unique,
	LabName varchar(255) not null default 'Unknown',
	LabOrganization varchar(255) not null default 'Unknown',
	LabMethodName varchar(255) not null default 'Unknown',
	LabMethodDescription text not null default 'Unknown',
	LabMethodLink varchar(500) default NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (LabMethodID)
	);

The following rules and best practices should be used when populating this table:
	1. The LabMethodID field is the primary key, must be a unique integer, and cannot be
	NULL. It should be implemented as an auto number/identity field.
	2. All of the fields in this table are required and cannot be null except for the
	LabMethodLink.
	3. The default value for all of the required fields except for the LabMethodID is
	“Unknown.”
	4. A single record should exist in this table where the LabMethodID = 0 and the LabName,
	LabOrganization, LabMethdodName, and LabMethodDescription fields are equal to
	“Unknown” and the LabMethodLink = NULL. This record should be used to identify
	samples in the Samples table for which nothing is known about the laboratory method
	used to analyze the sample.
