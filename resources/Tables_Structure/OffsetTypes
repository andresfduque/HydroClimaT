Table: OffsetTypes

The OffsetTypes table lists full descriptive information for each of the measurement offsets.

CREATE TABLE OffsetTypes (
	OffsetTypeID serial unique,
	OffsetUnitsID integer not null references Units(UnitsID),
	OffsetDescription text not null,
	PRIMARY KEY (OffsetTypeID)
	);

The following rules and best practices should be followed when populating this table:
	1. Although all three fields in this table are mandatory, this table will only be populated if
	data values measured at an offset have been entered into the ODM database.
	2. The OffsetTypeID field is the primary key, must be a unique integer, and cannot be
	NULL. This field should be implemented as an auto number/identity field.
	3. The OffsetUnitsID field should reference a valid ID from the UnitsID field in the Units
	table. Because the Units table is a controlled vocabulary, only units that already exist in
	the Units table can be used as the units of the offset.
	4. The OffsetDescription field should be filled in with a complete text description of the
	offset that provides enough information to interpret the type of offset being used. For
	example, “Distance from stream bank” is ambiguous because it is not known which bank
	is being referred to.
