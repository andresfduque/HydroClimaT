Table: QualityControlLevels

The QualityControlLevels table contains the quality control levels that are used for versioning
data within the database.

CREATE TABLE QualityControlLevels (
	QualityControlLevelID serial unique,
	QualityControlLevelCode varchar(50) not null,
	Definition varchar(255) not null,
	Explanation text not null,
	PRIMARY KEY (QualityControlLevelID)
	);

This table is pre-populated with quality control levels 0 through 4 within the ODM. The
following rules and best practices should be used when populating this table:
	1. The QualityControlLevelID field is the primary key, must be a unique integer, and cannot
	be NULL. This field should be implemented as an auto number/identity field.
	2. It is suggested that the pre-populated system of quality control level codes (i.e.,
	QualityControlLevelCodes 0 â€“ 4) be used. If the pre-populated list is not sufficient, new
	quality control levels can be defined. A quality control level code of -9999 is suggested
	for data whose quality control level is unknown.
