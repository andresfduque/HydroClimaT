Table: DerivedFrom

The DerivedFrom table contains the linkage between derived data values and the data values that
they were derived from.

	CREATE TABLE DerivedFrom (
		DerivedFromID integer,
		ValueID integer not null,
		PRIMARY KEY (DerivedFromID)
		);

The following rules and best practices should be used in populating this table:
	1. Although all of the fields in this table are mandatory, they need only be populated if
	derived data values and the data values that they were derived from are entered into the
	database. If there are no derived data in the DataValues table, this table will be empty.
