Table: Groups

The Groups table lists the groups of data values that have been created and the data values that
are within each group.

	CREATE TABLE Groups (
		GroupID integer references....,
		ValueID integer references....,
		PRIMARY KEY (GroupID)
		);

The following rules and best practices should be used in populating this table:
	1. This table will only be populated if groups of data values have been created in the ODM
	database.
	2. The GroupID field must reference a valid GroupID from the GroupDescriptions table,
	and the GroupDescriptions table should be populated for a group prior to populating the
	Groups table.
