Table: ISOMetadata

The ISOMetadata table contains dataset and project level metadata required by the CUAHSI HIS
metadata system (http://www.cuahsi.org/his/documentation.html) for compliance with standards
such as the draft ISO 19115 or ISO 8601. The mandatory fields in this table must be populated
to provide a complete set of ISO compliant metadata in the database.

CREATE TABLE ISOMetadata (
	MetadataID serial unique,
	TopicCategory varchar(255) not null default 'Unknown' references TopicCategoryCV(Term),
	Title varchar(255) not null default 'Unknown',
	Abstract text not null default 'Unknown',
	ProfileVersion varchar(255) not null default 'Unknown',
	MetadataLink varchar(500) default NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (MetadataID)
	);

The following rules and best practices should be used in populating this table:
	1. The MetadataID field is the primary key, must be a unique integer, and cannot be NULL.
	This field should be implemented as an auto number/identity field.
	2. All of the fields in this table are mandatory and cannot be NULL except for the
	MetadataLink field.
	3. The TopicCategory field should only be populated with terms from the
	TopicCategoryCV table. The default controlled vocabulary term is “Unknown.”
	4. The Title field should be populated with a brief text description of what the referenced
	data represent. This field can be populated with “Unknown” if there is no title for the
	data.
	5. The Abstract field should be populated with a more complete text description of the data
	that the metadata record references. This field can be populated with “Unknown” if there
	is no abstract for the data.
	6. The ProfileVersion field should be populated with the version of the ISO metadata profile
	that is being used. This field can be populated with “Unknown” if there is no profile
	version for the data.
	7. One record with a MetadataID = 0 should exist in this table with TopicCategory, Title,
	Abstract, and ProfileVersion = “Unknown” and MetadataLink = NULL. This record
	should be the default value for sources with unknown/unspecified metadata.

POPULATE DATA FOR UNKNOWN ISOMetadata

INSERT INTO ISOMetadata (TopicCategory, Title, Abstract, ProfileVersion, MetadataLink)
	VALUES ('Unknown', 'Unknown', 'Unknown', 'Unknown', NULL)
