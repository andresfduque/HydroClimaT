Table: Methods

The Methods table lists the methods used to collect the data and any additional information about
the method.

CREATE TABLE Methods (
	MethodID serial unique,
	MethodDescription text not null,
	MethodLink varchar(500) default NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (MethodID)
	);

The following rules and best practices should be used when populating this table:
	1. The MethodID field is the primary key, must be a unique integer, and cannot be NULL.
	2. There is no default value for the MethodDescription field in this table. Rather, this table
	should contain a record with MethodID = 0, MethodDescription = “Unknown”, and
	MethodLink = NULL. A MethodID of 0 should be used as the MethodID for any data
	values for which the method used to create the value is unknown (i.e., the default value
	for the MethodID field in the DataValues table is 0).
	3. Methods should describe the manner in which the observation was collected (i.e.,
	collected manually, or collected using an automated sampler) or measured (i.e., measured
	using a temperature sensor or measured using a turbidity sensor). Details about the
	specific sensor models and manufacturers can be included in the MethodDescription.
