Table: Samples

The Samples table gives information about physical samples analyzed in a laboratory.

CREATE TABLE Samples (
	SampleID serial unique,
	SampleType varchar(255) not null references SampleTypeCV(Term),
	LabSampleCode varchar(50) not null,
	LabMethodID integer not null references LabMethods(LabMethodID),
	PRIMARY KEY (SampleID)
	);

The following rules and best practices should be followed when populating this table:
	1. This table will only be populated if data values associated with physical samples are
	added to the ODM database.
	2. The SamplID field is the primary key, must be a unique integer, and cannot be NULL.
	This field should be implemented as an auto number/identity field.
	3. The SampleType field should be populated using terms from the SampleTypeCV table.
	Where the sample type is unknown, a default value of “Unknown” can be used.
	4. The LabSampleCode should be a unique text code used by the laboratory to identify the
	sample. This field is an alternate key for this table and should be unique.
	5. The LabMethodID must reference a valid LabMethodID from the LabMethods table.
	The LabMethods table should be populated with the appropriate laboratory method
	information prior to adding records to this table that reference that laboratory method. A
	default value of 0 for this field indicates that nothing is known about the laboratory
	method used to analyze the sample.
