INSERT INTO ValueTypeCV (Term,Definition)
	VALUES ('Calibration Value','A value used as part of the calibration of an instrument at a particular time.'),
	('Derived Value','Data are the result of a mathematical transformation where there is some subjectivity in the selected equation form and/or where parameters are typically fitted. A rating curve relating stage to discharge is a transformation that fits this definition; therefore stage is observed but discharge is derived.'),
	('Estimated Value','Values that are roughly calculated, judged, or approximated. Values may result from professional judgement or from ancillary data.'),
	('Field Observation','Data reflect the measurement the sensor is designed to make, reported at the frequency of data collection'),
	('Model Simulation Result','Values generated by a simulation model'),
	('Sample','Observation that is the result of analyzing a sample in a laboratory'),
	('Unknown','The value type is unknown');
