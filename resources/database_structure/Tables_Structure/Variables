Table: Variables

The ValueTypeCV table contains the controlled vocabulary for the ValueType field in the
Variables and SeriesCatalog tables.

CREATE TABLE Variables (
	VariableID serial unique,
	VariableCode varchar(50) not null,
	VariableName varchar(255) not null references VariableNameCV(Term),
	Speciation varchar(255) not null default 'Not Applicable' references SpeciationCV(Term),
	VariableUnitsID integer not null references Units(UnitsID),
	SampleMedium varchar(255) not null default 'Unknown' references SampleMediumCV(Term),
	ValueType varchar(255) not null default 'Unknown' references ValueTypeCV(Term),
	IsRegular boolean not null default false,
	TimeSupport real not null default 0,
	TimeUnitsID integer not null default 103 references Units(UnitsID),
	DataType varchar(255) not null default 'Unknown' references DataTypeCV(Term),
	GeneralCategory varchar(255) not null default 'Unknown' references GeneralCategoryCV(Term),
	NoDataValue real not null default -9999,
	PRIMARY KEY (VariableID)
	);

The following rules and best practices should be followed when populating this table:
	1. The VariableID field is the primary key, must be a unique integer, and cannot be NULL.
	This field should be implemented as an auto number/identity field.
	2. The VariableCode field must be unique and serves as an alternate key for this table.
	Variable codes can be arbitrary, or they can use an organized system. VaraibleCodes
	cannot contain any characters other than A-Z (case insensitive), 0-9, period “.”, dash “-“,
	and underscore “_”.
	3. The VariableName field must reference a valid Term from the VariableNameCV
	controlled vocabulary table.
	4. The Speciation field must reference a valid Term from the SpeciationCV controlled
	vocabulary table. A default value of “Not Applicable” is used where speciation does not
	apply. If the speciation is unknown, a value of “Unknown” can be used.
	5. The VariableUnitsID field must reference a valid UnitsID from the UnitsTable controlled
	vocabulary table.
	6. Only terms from the SampleMediumCV table can be used to populate the
	SampleMedium field. A default value of “Unknown” is used where the sample medium
	is unknown.
	7. Only terms from the ValueTypeCV table can be used to populate the ValueType field. A
	default value of “Unknown” is used where the value type is unknown.
	8. The default for the TimeSupport field is 0. This corresponds to instantaneous values. If
	the TimeSupport field is set to a value other than 0, an appropriate TimeUnitsID must be
	specified. The TimeUnitsID field can only reference valid UnitsID values from the Units
	controlled vocabulary table. If the TimeSupport field is set to 0, any time units can be
	used (i.e., seconds, minutes, hours, etc.), however a default value of 103 has been used,
	which corresponds with hours.
	9. Only terms from the DataTypeCV table can be used to populated the DataType field. A
	default value of “Unknown” can be used where the data type is unknown.
	10. Only terms from the GeneralCategoryCV table can be used to populate the
	GeneralCategory field. A default value of “Unknown” can be used where the general
	category is unknown.
	11. The NoDataValue should be set such that it will never conflict with a real observation
	value. For example a NoDataValue of -9999 is valid for water temperature because we
	would never expect to measure a water temperature of -9999. The default value for this
	field is -9999.
